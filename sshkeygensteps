how do we setup master slave in jenkins 

first step in master need to run command

ssh-keygen

after that need to enter 3times because we use to get public and private keys after that you can go inside .ssh folder and copy id_rsa file into the target server.
cd .ssh
once login to the .ssh folder you use to run below command before that you use to get the target server ip address and paste it where ever i used the ip address.

ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@18.116.238.4 

once done above command it will ask you the passwd you can use it what ever passwd you kept for slave machine user passwd.

run the below command

ssh 18.116.238.4


slave machine:

in slave machine you need to  modify sshd file

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PermitRootLogin yes

PasswordAuthentication yes


once modified these lines you need to restart the sshd file

service sshd restart
systemctl restart sshd


after that need to setup passwd for user 

passwd root
12345 

you can use this passwd where ever passwd asking.
